"""Mimic exercise

Read in the file specified on the command line.
Do a simple split() on whitespace to obtain all the words in the file.
Rather than read the file line by line, it's easier to read it into
one giant string and split it once.

Note: the standard python module 'random' includes a random.choice(list)
method which picks a random element from a non-empty list.

You can try adding in line breaks around 70 columns so the output looks
better.
